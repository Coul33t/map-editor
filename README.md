# Map Editor
Heyo amigo, this is the map editor you've been dreaming of your whole life! I'm jsut kidding, this is a map editor I developped for my kinda-no-more-developped isometric tactical RPG. While I developped it for this purpose, it can be use for any project, as long as you create an import function in your program to use it.
